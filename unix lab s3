3.The command is mancal:
options are
-h      Turns off highlighting of today.

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -o option, display
             date of Orthodox Easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of Easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.  If month is specified as a decimal
             number, appending ‘f’ or ‘p’ displays 
     -o      Display date of Orthodox Easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego‐
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.
 -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year. This option is implied
             when a year but no month are specified on the command line.

     -3      Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today.

     -1      Display only the current month. This is the default.

     -A number
             Months to add after. The specified number of months is added to
             the end of the display. This is in addition to any date range
             selected by the -y, -3, or -1 options. For example, “cal -y -B2
             -A2” shows everything from November of the previous year to Feb‐
             ruary of the following year. Negative numbers are allowed, in
             which case the specified number of months is subtracted. For
             example, “cal -y -B-6” shows July to December. And “cal -A11”
             simply shows the next 12 months.
     -N      Switch to ncal mode.

     -d yyyy-mm
             Use yyyy-mm as the current date (for debugging of date selec‐
             tion).

     -H yyyy-mm-dd
             Use yyyy-mm-dd as the current date (for debugging of highlight‐
             ing).

     -M      Weeks start on Monday.

     -S      Weeks start on Sunday.

     -b      Use oldstyle format for ncal output.
